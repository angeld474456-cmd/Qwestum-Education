# Qwestum-Education Project Context

Qwestum-Education is an educational quest platform built with Next.js 16, TypeScript, Tailwind, and Supabase.

The product lets teachers create learning quests made of modular tasks, preview those tasks while editing, and run quests in a student-facing play mode.

## Teacher Experience Status

Completed Sprint 12 work:

- Sprint 12.1 — Teacher Quest Library at `/dashboard/quests`.
  - Loads quests with `getQuests()`.
  - Loads task counts with `getAllQuestTasks()`.
  - Shows `title`, `description`, `difficulty`, Public/Draft from `is_public`, `created_at`, and task count.
  - Links to settings, edit tasks, preview, and play/test.
- Sprint 12.2 — Teacher Preview / Play Routes.
  - `/dashboard/quests/[id]/preview` renders all tasks read-only with `TaskRenderer` in `mode="preview"`.
  - `/dashboard/quests/[id]/play` mounts `QuestRunner`.
  - Answers and results are not persisted yet.
- Sprint 12.3 — Teacher Quest Settings / Publish Controls.
  - `/dashboard/quests/[id]/settings` edits only `title`, `description`, `difficulty`, and `is_public`.
  - Saves through `updateQuest(id, { title, description, difficulty, is_public })`.
  - `is_public = true` means Public; `is_public = false` means Draft.
  - No `status` field and no migration were added.
- Sprint 12.4 — Teacher Quest Workspace Navigation.
  - `components/dashboard/QuestWorkspaceNav.tsx` is used in settings, preview, and play pages.
  - Task editing intentionally remains at `/quests/[id]/tasks`.
- Sprint 12.5 - Teacher Task Editor Dashboard Integration.
  - Added `QuestWorkspaceNav` to the existing task editor route at `/quests/[id]/tasks`.
  - The task editor now shows workspace navigation with `active="tasks"`.
  - No dashboard task route was created.
  - No editor logic, task components, services, runtime, migrations, or JSONB architecture were changed.
  - The task editor route intentionally remains outside `/dashboard` for now to avoid breaking the existing working editor.
- Sprint 12.6 - Teacher Workspace Polish / Route Consistency.
  - Completed route consistency analysis.
  - `Open / Edit quest` in `/dashboard/quests` now points to `/dashboard/quests/[id]/settings`.
  - Removed the duplicate `Settings` action from quest cards.
  - Current library actions are `Open / Edit quest`, `Edit tasks`, `Preview`, and `Play/Test`.
  - Legacy routes `/quests/[id]` and `/quests/[id]/tasks` are intentionally preserved.
- Sprint 12.7 - Breadcrumbs / Page Title Analysis.
  - No breadcrumbs are planned for the current MVP.
  - No shared `QuestWorkspaceHeader` is planned yet.
  - Current dashboard page titles are acceptable for MVP: `Teacher Quest Library`, `Quest Settings`, `Teacher Preview`, and `Teacher Test Mode`.
  - Task editor title/text remains unchanged because `/quests/[id]/tasks` is a legacy route with Russian UI text and mojibake risk.
- Sprint 12.8 - Teacher Quest Analytics.
  - Added teacher-only content analytics summary to `/dashboard/quests`.
  - Shows Total quests, Public quests, Draft quests, Total tasks, and Total points.
  - Uses existing `getQuests()` and `getAllQuestTasks()` data only.
  - No persisted attempts/results exist yet.
  - Student learning analytics are deferred until answer persistence, auth, privacy, and schema decisions are made.
- Sprint 12.9 - Attempt Persistence / Student Analytics Architecture.
  - No attempt persistence is implemented yet.
  - No migrations, attempt services, routes, runtime changes, task editor changes, or JSONB changes were added.
  - Teacher Test Mode remains local-only for now.
  - Future persistence should target real student attempts after auth, RLS, privacy, and schema decisions.
  - Future table concepts: `quest_attempts` and `quest_attempt_answers`.

Next sprint:

- Sprint 12.10 - Auth / RLS Boundaries Analysis.

- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind
- Supabase

## Important Notes For Future Codex Chats

- This is a long-running project. Preserve existing architecture unless the user explicitly asks for a redesign.
- The task editor and runtime renderer are modular. Add new task types through the existing registry/renderer patterns.
- Russian UI text exists throughout the app and must be preserved.
- Some shell output may display Russian text as mojibake. Check actual source files before changing UI text.
- Do not commit or push unless explicitly asked.
